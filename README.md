Recently, the workflow of **"pre-train, fine-tune"** has been shown less effective and efficient when dealing with diverse downstream tasks on the graph domain. Inspired by the prompt learning in the natural language processing (NLP) domain, the **"pre-train, prompt"** workflow has emerged as a promising solution.

This repo aims to provide a curated list of research papers that explore the prompt learning on graphs. It is based on our Survey Paper: [Graph Prompt Learning: A Comprehensive Survey and Beyond](#). We will try to make this list updated frequently. If you find any error or any missed paper, please don't hesitate to open issues or pull requests. :seedling:
